📘 Milestone 1

Built a basic Agentic AI using LangGraph that can understand a task, use tools, and generate a final response in a single execution.
The agent workflow and state management were implemented and verified using LangSmith tracing.

📘 Milestone 2

Enhanced the agent with a virtual file system to manage long context.
The agent saves intermediate results using write_file, retrieves them using read_file, and generates a final combined output.
Correct tool usage was verified through LangSmith traces.
