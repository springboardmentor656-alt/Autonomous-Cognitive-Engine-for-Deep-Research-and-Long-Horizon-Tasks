# Autonomous-Cognitive-Engine-for-Deep-Research-and-Long-Horizon-Tasks
PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project implements an Autonomous Multi-Agent Research System capable of handling complex, long-horizon research tasks with minimal human intervention.

Instead of simple question-answering, this system:

Understands a complex research prompt

Breaks it into structured sub-tasks

Executes each task step-by-step

Stores intermediate outputs in memory

Synthesizes a final professional report

Evaluates its own performance

The architecture simulates how a human researcher works end-to-end.
