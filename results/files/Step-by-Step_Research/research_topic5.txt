Edge Computing refers to the processing and analysis of data at the edge of a network, closer to the source of the data, reducing latency and enabling real-time decision-making, and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of applications and systems. This technology has the potential to transform industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and energy management, enabling greater autonomy, flexibility, and resilience in the face of changing conditions.
